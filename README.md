# Jodrell-Bank-Observatory

This repository contains data that Kento Shiba obtained and used from Jodrell Bank's Lovell telescope and the 42 ft telescope. The data was used to find out the dispersion measure, magnetic field, period derivative, and distance from Earth and finally, the characteristic age of the crab pulsar. 

6 datasets of unknown pulsars were also analysed from which the fundamental frequency reconstructed signal of unknown pulsars were found.
